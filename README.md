This website is all about me.

It contains 4 html pages, and one stylesheet.Each page is divided into 2 columns, implemented using Bootstrap's grid model.

The first column contains the Navigation hyperlinks to permit a visitor to get from any page on the website to any other page.
Navigation hyperlinks are implemented using the Bootstrap "list-group" component. The current page is highlighted in the navigation
list group.

The 2nd column on each page contains details related to the page heading.

- index.html
The main page demonstrates use of #id selector, .class selector, inheritance, and @media query. The @media query is used to hide
certain sections when the page is printed, and to change the styling for the page header on small screen sizes. The color of the
heading is set by the $headcolor variable.

- MySpecialities.html
This page also uses two Bootstrap columns for layout purposes, and demonstrates contents displayed as an Unordered list, and an
example of SCCS nesting.

- MyInterests
This page contains images related to activities of interest

- WhereIHaveLived.html
This page displays a table, listing the Cities and Countries I have lived in, and a famous landmark in that city. The table size is set to 75%
of the column width. Odd and Even rows of the table are shaded with a different background.
